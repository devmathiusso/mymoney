# MyMoney Project

An application built with ReactJS and Firebase.

This is my very first project in ReactJS and Firebase.

Project URL: <https://mymoney-mathiusso.firebaseapp.com/login>

To log in into the application:

**E-mail:** dev.mathiusso@gmail.com  
**Password:** abc123

I'm following a ReactJS course, so I won't implement registration on this application because the instructor will teach this later on.
